smbridge
========

Java Bridge connecting a POSIX client to a WebSockets client. 

Used with smsolver, which connects the Java SCXML builder (that uses the clingo answer-set solver) to the Javascript SCXML viewer that runs in the browser (using WebSockets).

This is no longer needed since smsolver can now also use WebSockets ('-w').
